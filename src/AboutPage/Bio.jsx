      <p>
        Hi everyone! My name is Bogas Ratha Putra. I'm a web developer from Bogor, West Java. 
        I have 1 year of experience in back-end web development. I really enjoy what I do right now, 
        in my opinion, creating programs is not just a job, but also an art that has aesthetic value.
      </p>
      <p>
        My job is to build your website to be functional and user-friendly yet still attractive. 
        In addition, I provide a personal touch to your product and ensure that the website catches 
        attention and is easy to use. My goal is to convey your message and identity in the most 
        creative way. If you are interested in hiring me, please contact the listed contact.
